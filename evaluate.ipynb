The implementation: In an app for an online fast fashion e-commerce platform, the user uploads a video in which the whole body of the user is within frame and the user turns 360 degree. Using the data from the video, the app reconstructs a 3d avatar which is shaped accurately by the measurements of the user. The avatar has almost the same face and hairstyle as the user. In the app there are also 3D clothes that can be 'tried on' by the avatar, and the avatar can also do different poses. Suitable outfits are recommended based on the measurements of the avatar (e.g. height, length of limbs). Similar items from different fashion brands are suggested to the user based on their previous choice of fashion items.\n",

Then, you need to take into account the 1.5% depreciation of the cars per month. This means that the $6000 value of the new car decreases by 1.5% each month. To account for this, you need to multiply the 6 months by 1.5% and add that to the 6 months, giving you 60 months in total.

He also used fear tactics to manipulate public opinion, such as the burning of books and the passing of anti-Semitic laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitler's most decisive move was the passage of the Enabling Act in March of 1933, which granted him the authority to pass laws without parliamentary approval. This allowed him to bypass the democratic process and gave him the power to take control of the German government. He then appointed Nazi Party members to key positions in government, including the Reichstag, the Supreme Court and the Cabinet.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the mid-1930s, Hitler had successfully taken control of Germany. He used a combination of terror, propaganda and economic incentives to entrench his power and create an authoritarian state. He was able to hold onto power for almost a decade until his eventual downfall in 1945.\n",

New cryptocurrencies are being created all the time, and existing ones are being updated with new features and improvements.\n",
      "\\vskip6pt\\noindent\n",
      "\\texttt{OPT-6.7B-SFT}: Cryptocurrencies can be improved by making them more secure, faster, and more user-friendly. Cryptocurrencies can be revamped by making them more decentralized, more scalable, and more accessible to a wider range of users.\n",
      "\\vskip6pt\\noindent\n",
      "\\texttt{OPT-6.7B-kNN}: Cryptocurrencies can be improved by addressing the following issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Security: Cryptocurrencies need to be more secure to prevent hacking and theft.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Regulation: Cryptocurrencies need to be regulated to ensure that they are used for legitimate purposes and to prevent fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Scalability: Cryptocurrencies need to be able to scale to handle larger transactions and to keep up with the growing demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Adoption: Cryptocurrencies need to be more widely adopted to become mainstream.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Education: Cryptocurrencies need to be better understood and more widely accepted to become more popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Infrastructure: Cryptocurrencies need to have better infrastructure to support their use.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Accessibility: Cryptocurrencies need to be more accessible to a wider range of people\n",
      "\\vskip6pt\\noindent\n",
      "\\texttt{OPT-6.7B-Random}: Cryptocurrencies can be improved in a number of ways. One way is to increase the speed and efficiency of transactions. This can be done by improving the underlying technology, such as blockchain, and by increasing the number of nodes in the network. Another way to improve cryptocurrencies is to make them more user-friendly and accessible. This can be done by making it easier to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and by providing more educational resources to help people understand how they work. Finally, cryptocurrencies can be improved by increasing their security. This can be done by implementing more robust security measures, such as two-factor authentication and encryption.\n",
      "\\vskip6pt\\noindent\n",
      "\\texttt{OPT-6.7B-ISARIL}: 1. Increase scalability: One of the biggest challenges facing cryptocurrencies is the limited throughput of the blockchain technology that underpins them. To address this challenge, developers need to create new technologies that increase the scalability of the system, such as sidechains, sharding, and Lightning Network. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Improve privacy: Cryptocurrencies are not anonymous, and the transaction data is publicly available. To improve privacy, developers need to create new technologies that are designed to make transactions more secure and anonymous, such as ring signatures and zero-knowledge proofs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Increase usability: Cryptocurrencies are difficult to use for most people, and the user experience needs to be improved. Developers need to create new technology that makes it easier for people to use cryptocurrencies, such as simpler wallet interfaces and improved payment protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Increase security: Cryptocurrencies are susceptible to hacks and thefts, and the security of the system needs to be improved. To increase security, developers need to create new technologies that make it harder for hackers to breach the system, such as multi-signature wallets and improved encryption protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Implement better regulations: Cryptocurrencies are currently not regulated, and this has caused some problems. To address this, developers need to work with governments and regulators to implement better regulations that protect users and ensure the stability of the system.\n",

First published in 1925, it is set on Long Island's North Shore and in New York City during the summer of 1922. The novel chronicles an era that saw a nation move from the Victorian era to the Jazz Age. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.\n",

This decision is entirely his own, and it sets off a chain of events that leads to the tragedy.\n",

By killing Tybalt, Romeo brings down the full force of the law upon himself and is banished from Verona. This is a major factor in the chain of events that leads to the tragedy.\n",

      "Romeo’s inability to communicate effectively with Juliet is also a major factor in the tragedy. Despite their love for each other, Romeo and Juliet are unable to communicate with each other and share their plans. Romeo does not tell Juliet of his plan to fake his own death, and Juliet does not tell Romeo of her plan to take a potion instead of going through with a forced marriage. This lack of communication is a major factor in the tragedy.\n",

With film photography, you have to wait for the photo to be developed, which can take days or even weeks. This gives you time to think about the photo and how you want it to look. Third, film photography is more expensive than digital photography. This can be a deterrent for some people, but for others, it adds to the experience. Fourth, film photography is more nostalgic.

      "Review 1: I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\n",

      "A: According to Statista, there were an estimated 7.5 billion text messages sent globally in a single minute in 2019. This number is likely to have increased since then, given the widespread adoption of mobile technology and the growth of messaging apps. \n",
      "\n",
      "To calculate the number of text messages sent in a minute, we must first look at the total number of text messages sent per day globally. According to a 2019 report from Portio Research, there were an estimated 8.3 trillion text messages sent worldwide in 2019. This number can then be divided by the total number of minutes in a day (1440) to work out the estimated number of text messages sent globally in a single minute. This would mean that approximately 5.8 million text messages are sent globally every minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this number is likely to be lower than the actual number of text messages sent in a minute. This is because this calculation does not take into account the increasing use of messaging apps, which are becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to traditional SMS texting. Messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger do not count as SMS, and therefore are not included in this calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, taking into account the growing use of messaging apps, the estimated number of text messages sent globally in a single minute is likely to be higher than 5.8 million. According to Statista, this number is 7.5 billion text messages globally in a single minute.\n",

      "A: Social media platforms have drastically changed the way people consume and share news. By providing easy access to a wide variety of news sources, they allow users to engage with news content more quickly and easily than ever before. This has given rise to the spread of misinformation, as users can quickly and easily spread false or misleading information without fact-checking or verifying the accuracy of the content. Additionally, algorithms used by social media platforms to personalize content to users can lead to people becoming increasingly isolated in their news consumption, as they are only exposed to content that reinforces their existing views and beliefs. This can lead to the spread of false or biased information, as users are not exposed to a diverse range of news sources and perspectives.\n",
